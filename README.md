📚 Library Hustle: Manage Books Like a Boss

Yo, listen up! This here is Library Hustle, a console-based app where you run your book game. Add ’em, delete ‘em, search ‘em, flex ‘em—all at your command. This ain’t your grandma’s library system. Let’s roll. 💯

🔥 What’s the Deal?

This app’s got your back with:
	•	📘 Adding Books: Throw in that new title, and we got it locked with a unique ID. Boom.
	•	❌ Deleting Books: Don’t like it? Toss it. Just gimme the ID.
	•	🔍 Searching Books: You need it? You find it. By title, author, or year—whatever.
	•	📋 Showing All Books: Wanna flex the whole stack? Display it all.
	•	🔄 Changing Status: Lend it out or keep it in. You’re the boss.


💾 Data Lives Here

All your books are kept safe in a JSON file. That means the library’s in your hands, even if you bounce for a bit.

🎮 How to Play

    First, grab the goods:
        git clone https://github.com/your-repo/library-hustle.git

2.	Run the Game:
    Fire it up with:
        python main.py

3.	Follow the Menu:

            •	“в наличии” (1): Keepin’ it in.
            •	“выдана” (2): Lent out.
    6.	Exit Like a Boss

💀 Handle Yo’ Mistakes

Don’t sweat it. If you:
